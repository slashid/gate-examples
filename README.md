# Gate Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating how to deploy and configure [SlashID Gate](https://www.slashid.dev/products/gate/). 
Gate is an identity-aware edge authorizer and authenticator that can be deployed as a standalone proxy, 
or as a sidecar to an existing API gateway or container. Gate's range of ready-to-use plugins and flexible configuration make
it easy to quickly add complex authentication and authorization to your APIs and workloads.
